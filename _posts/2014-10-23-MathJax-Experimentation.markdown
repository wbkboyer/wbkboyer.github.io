So, here it goes. Since this is going to be a more math-oriented blog than most, I'm going to need to set up the machinery to actually write nice mathematical text. This requires some fancy document processing engine work, such as that which is provided by [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org). The tutorial which I am following is written by Dason Kurkiewicz, found on his [professional blog](http://dasonk.com/blog/2012/10/09/Using-Jekyll-and-Mathjax/). Alternately,  Cecil Woebker proposed a different solution; although I did not use it, one can find it on his [professional blog](http://cwoebker.com/posts/latex-math-magic).

And so, without further ado, witness my mastery over MathJax used in conjunction with Jekyll!

$$x^2 + y^2 = z^2 +1$$

It's$$\ldots$$ Not very inspiring, is it. Erm. TA DA!
